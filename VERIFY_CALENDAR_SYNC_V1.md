# Verify Calendar Sync (v1)

Manual checklist for the guided setup on `/systems/calendar`.

- [ ] Inputs persist after refresh (time architecture, booking rules, focus protection, weekly reset, system of record)
- [ ] Step gating enforces completion before advancing; Finish disabled until all required checkboxes + system of record selected
- [ ] Copy buttons work for block plan, booking presets, focus event, and weekly reset templates
- [ ] Completion recap renders and reflects checkbox status
- [ ] Mobile layout acceptable (cards readable, stepper usable)
