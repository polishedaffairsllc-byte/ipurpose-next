        iPurpose Accelerator is a cohort-based guided program for meaning-driven creators who feel
        stuck, scattered, or unsure how to move forward. It helps you get clear
        about what you're building, remove internal blocks that slow you down,
        and turn insight into simple, ordered steps — with gentle support and
        structure along the way.
